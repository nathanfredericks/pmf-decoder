# PMF Decoder
Lightweight API for decoding PMF formatted PocketMine plugins.

This application works by calling PocketMine's own PMF decoder included in older (Shoghi-era) versions. **It is by no means secure and can easily be abused by a bad actor. Do not use this in production applications and ensure that the code is sandboxed with limits on storage.**
